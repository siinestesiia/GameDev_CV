I have been passionate about video games since childhood and i always found 3D graphics breathtaking. I'm constantly learning new things regarding both design and technology, as well as getting over new challenges.

## **Personal Projects**

### 3D Modeling with *Blender* (since 2020)
* In 2020 i started learning 3D modeling with **Blender** from books, courses, Youtube videos and people from different communities. As the time went by i explored different topics such as UV Unwrapping, Procedural Texturing, Rigging, Animating, Sculpting and recently Geometry Nodes. I found out that learning is an infinite process and i love that.

### Game Development
* In 2016 i made a one level game called **Phillip Against The Road** with **GameMaker** using its programming language **GML**. The art was made with **Pixela**. [Download and play](https://github.com/siinestesiia/Phillip_Against_The_Road), or watch the 
[Gameplay Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5tPDJoEzn4&ab_channel=GordoGamer).
* In 2020 i made a prototype 2.5D platform game using **Unity** and **c#**, with a capsule, boxes and cylinders. I modeled and animated a lowpoly character in **Blender**, but i never used it. [Platform Game Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9_OvK9Wq28&ab_channel=GordoGamer) and the [Code for the game assets](https://github.com/siinestesiia/PlatformGame_Scripts).
* I wrote a simple 2D game using **Pygame** in which you have to aim and shoot to a moving target to score points and if you miss 3 times, you loose. [Shooter Game Code](https://github.com/siinestesiia/shooter_game).
* I switched to **UPBGE** (*Blender Game Engine*) from **Unreal Engine 5**, due to its integrated **Python interpreter**.

### *Python* Programming
* During 2022 i learn **Python** from books that allowed me to write programs like games or task automation. For example: [Blender Project Directory Creator](https://github.com/siinestesiia/Blender_Project_Directory).

### Video Editing and Content Creation
* Since i was little i began to learn video and image editing. The first programs i used were **Windows Movie Maker**, **Vegas Pro** and later **Premiere Pro**.
* I have a Youtube channel called **GordoGamer** where i mix video editing, sound design and 3D modeling to make videos about videogame analysis.


## **Education**

* I study part of the Image and Sound Design carreer at the **University of Buenos Aires** but i decided to quit since it was turning out to be more political than artistic. Although i didn't finished 2nd year, i've learn a lot of usefull things.   
* I did a course on Smartphone Repair Technician at **CCTI** (02/07/16 - 06/29/16). I have learn the fundamentals of electricity, the tools needed for each task and how to continue learning in the field. This was the starting point to learn more about computers both hardware and software.  
* I did a course on Professional Photography at **IDES** (08/22/16 - 08/22/17). I have learn how to use a DSLR camera manually, how to control both natural and artificial light for a shot and how to edit photos. I use this knowledge when i do 3D.
* I'm a self-taught 3D artist and programmer and fortunately those two fit well together.


## **Working Experience**

* Since 2016 i repair smartphones and other electronic devices. I can diagnose the problem and proceed to repair it if possible, wether it be replacing components or soldering new ones.
* Since 2017 i work now and then as a freelance photographer taking portraits and covering events.
* I have experience in customer service, since i've been working in that area for many years in the gastronomic field.
* While i have not yet worked in the videogame industry, i'm eager to gain experience and learn along the way.


## **Programming Languages**

Intermediate proficiency of **Python** and recently learning **C++** to use it in **UE5**, but since i switch to **UPBGE**, i'm sticking to **Python**. I don't write in **C#** anymore since i don't use **Unity**, but if any project requires it, i can continue learning either **C#** or **C++** (or learn a new one!).


## **Software**

I've been using **Blender** for 3 years and i feel comfortable with its interface and navigation. 
I haven't used **Unity** in a while. However, if i have to, i still remember the basics. 
Regarding to operative systems, i can use either **Windows** or a **Linux** distribution like **Ubuntu**. 
For music and sound i use **Reaper**.
For image editing i'm currently using **GIMP**, but i used to use **Photoshop**.


## **Languages**

Fluent in **Spanish** (native), proficient in **English** (advanced) and intermediate in **French**.
